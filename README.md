## ðŸŽ“ FAQs

### ðŸ†˜ My site isn't correctly styled when built!

To reduce the size of the CSS, a plugin called (gatsby-plugin-purgecss)[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/] is used, which tries to remove unused CSS. Sometimes it fails to correctly detect the use of styles and removed needed styles. If there are some styling issues in the built site, this plugin may be the reason.
